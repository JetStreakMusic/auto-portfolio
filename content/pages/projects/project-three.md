  The goal of this project is to improve upon prior iterations of SailBot, an
  autonomous robotic sailboat. This was accomplished by improving the
  mechanical, electrical, and software systems already in place, as well as
  adding new systems. Our overall objective for this iteration is to increase
  the rigidity and reliability of the vehicle.
